# QoE Automation Frontend - Complete Implementation

## Overview
This document outlines the complete frontend implementation for the QoE Automation MVP built with React, TypeScript, and Material-UI.

## Technology Stack
- **React 18** with TypeScript
- **Material-UI (MUI)** for component library
- **React Router** for navigation
- **React Query (@tanstack/react-query)** for data fetching
- **Axios** for API communication
- **React Context** for authentication state
- **React Dropzone** for file uploads

## Key Features Implemented

### 1. Authentication & Authorization
- JWT-based authentication with persistent storage
- Role-based access control (Admin/Analyst)
- Protected routes and navigation
- User profile management in header

### 2. Dashboard
- Project overview with KPI cards
- Projects table with CRUD operations
- Create project dialog with form validation
- Role-based action buttons

### 3. Project Workspace
- Dynamic sidebar navigation based on project context
- Project header with client information
- Nested routing for different project sections

### 4. Document Management
- Drag & drop file upload with react-dropzone
- Support for PDF, DOCX, XLSX, CSV files
- Document status tracking (pending/processed/failed)
- File type and size validation
- Progress indicators and status cards

### 5. Adjustments Review
- Tabbed interface for different adjustment statuses
- AI-suggested adjustments with confidence scores
- Expandable rows with detailed information
- Review dialog for accepting/rejecting adjustments
- Manual adjustment creation
- 28+ predefined adjustment types

### 6. Questionnaires
- Dynamic question rendering based on type (text, number, boolean, multiple choice)
- AI-generated question indicators
- Accordion interface for better organization
- Response submission and history tracking
- Progress tracking with statistics

### 7. Reports Generation
- QA checklist validation before report generation
- Excel Data Book generation
- Word/PDF report generation
- Progress indicators and status monitoring
- Download functionality with proper file naming

### 8. Project Settings
- Basic project information management
- Materiality threshold configuration
- Team management interface
- Advanced settings with toggles
- Danger zone for project deletion (admin only)

## Component Architecture

### State Management
- React Query for server state management
- React Context for authentication state
- Local component state for UI interactions
- Optimistic updates with proper error handling

### Form Handling
- Controlled components with TypeScript
- Form validation with Material-UI
- Error handling and user feedback
- Conditional field rendering

### Data Flow
1. API calls through centralized service layer
2. React Query for caching and synchronization
3. TypeScript interfaces for type safety
4. Material-UI components for consistent UI

## API Integration

All components are integrated with the backend API through:

### Services Layer (`api.ts`)
- **authAPI**: Login, token refresh, user management
- **projectsAPI**: CRUD operations for projects
- **documentsAPI**: File upload, document management
- **adjustmentsAPI**: Adjustment review and creation
- **questionnairesAPI**: Q&A management
- **reportsAPI**: Report generation and QA checklist

### Error Handling
- Global error boundaries
- API error responses with user-friendly messages
- Loading states and progress indicators
- Retry mechanisms for failed requests

## User Experience Features

### Responsive Design
- Mobile-friendly layout with Material-UI breakpoints
- Collapsible sidebar for smaller screens
- Responsive tables and cards

### Accessibility
- ARIA labels and semantic HTML
- Keyboard navigation support
- Screen reader compatibility
- High contrast color schemes

### Performance Optimizations
- Code splitting with React Router
- Lazy loading of components
- React Query caching
- Optimized re-renders with proper key props

## Material-UI Theme Integration
- Consistent color scheme and typography
- Custom theme configuration
- Icon usage throughout the interface
- Proper spacing and layout patterns

## File Upload Functionality
- Drag & drop interface with visual feedback
- Multiple file selection
- File type and size validation
- Upload progress indicators
- Error handling for failed uploads

## Data Visualization
- Progress bars for completion tracking
- Status chips with color coding
- Statistical cards with icons
- Rating components for confidence scores

## Navigation & Routing
- Nested routing for project workspace
- Protected routes with authentication checks
- Breadcrumb navigation
- Dynamic sidebar based on context

## Security Considerations
- JWT token management with auto-refresh
- Role-based UI element visibility
- Input validation and sanitization
- Secure API communication with axios interceptors

## Testing Considerations
- TypeScript for compile-time error catching
- Proper component props typing
- Mock data for development and testing
- Error boundary implementation

## Deployment Ready
- Environment variable configuration
- Docker support
- Production build optimization
- Asset bundling and minification

This frontend implementation provides a complete, production-ready interface for the QoE Automation system with modern React best practices, comprehensive TypeScript typing, and a polished Material-UI design system.
